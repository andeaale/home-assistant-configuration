# Home-Assistant Configuration

This is my personal home automation configuration using Home Assistant (http://home-assistant.io) - hereby referred to as HA.  My configuration is built off of many online docs, tips, and examples over many grueling hours of trial and error.  I've tried to document what I've learned so hopefully it will help others (and prevent me from making the same mistakes twice).

## Server
Here are the exact components (and where I bought them) for my $119.21 HA server:
* [CanaKit Raspberry Pi 3 with 2.5A Micro USB Power Supply (UL Listed)](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B01C6FFNY4/ref=oh_aui_detailpage_o04_s00?ie=UTF8&psc=1)
